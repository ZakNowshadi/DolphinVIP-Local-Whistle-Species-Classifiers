Brief Overview of Hyperparameter Optimisation

Basic Method One: Random
- Create a grid of possible values for hyperparameters
- Each iteration tries a random combinations from this grid and records performance
- At the end it returns the combination of hyperparameters that provides the best performance

Basic Method Two: Grid
- Creates a grid of possible values for hyperparameters
- Each iteration tries a combination in a specific order
- It fits the model on every combination of hyperparameters possible and records performance
- A the end it returns the best model with the best hyperparameters.

TOOLS 


Optuna:

- Allows user to describe a search space where user expects the best results 
- Does random search, along with others like TPE and adaptive TPE
